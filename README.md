## **Database Schema**

The system uses a relational database schema to store the inventory data. Here are some of the main tables:

- **items**: Stores the details of each inventory item, including name, description, and quantity.
- **subareas**: Represents different categories like "Dance" or "Theater".
- **item_subareas**: A join table linking items to subareas.
- **photos**: Stores photos associated with each item for easy visual identification.

---

## **How It Works**

The system allows users to interact with a detailed catalog of costume and apparel items. Users can add new items, update quantities, and assign them to specific subareas like **Theater** or **Dance**.

The app automatically tracks item movements and stores metadata about each item, including associated photos.

In addition, users can filter and view all items belonging to a specific subarea or inventory.
